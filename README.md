# Open sourcify

Setup automatic publishing with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), commit message validation and [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

## Usage

```
yarn global add open-sourcify
# In your open source repo
open-sourcify
```

- Automatic publishing will be setup for you, based on [those rules](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#default-commit-message-format).

- You will be able to easily follow commit messages conventions by using `yarn commit` instead of `git commit`

## Contributing

Use `yarn commit` for your commits.
